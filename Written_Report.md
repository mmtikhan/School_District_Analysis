# School Data Analysis Project

## Overview of Project
During this project the data from high schools will be analyzed and organized. The main deliverables that required for this project:

  Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
  The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
  School performance based on the budget per student
  School performance based on the school size
  School performance based on the type of school
At the end of the Analysis we received the information that the scores from Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered and should be removed from the report.


### Purpose
To identify the successful and unsuccessful schools in order to create future targets and goals. To remove ninth graders' scores from Thomas High School results.

### Performing programming.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Using Jupiter and additional libraries requires additional education which takes some time.
